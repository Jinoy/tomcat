These playbooks deploy Tomcat Application Server,version 7. 


When the playbook run completes, you should be able to see the Tomcat
Application Server running on the ports you chose, on the target machines.

This is a very simple playbook and could serve as a starting point for more
complex Tomcat-based projects.
